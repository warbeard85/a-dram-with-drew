Im sitting in my back garden on the eve of Easter Sunday. Across the world many people are self isolating due to the Covid-19 crisis. The world at least in the moment has changed. The sun has dropped below the horizon and an already still world has began to still further.  This is a time many of us will never forget and as I write this first post it is also a moment that I will never forget, punctuated by the dram of Laphroaig ten years old on my garden table.

Laphroaig is a heavily peated whisky in the style that has become synonmous from the island of Islay.  In your face, uncompromising, yet beneath its brash personality lies a complex array of taste and character.  Many people will not like Laphroaig, some might liken it to marmite in terms of character, you either love it or you hate it. I am the former.


**The Nose**

The first smell of this whisky gives you a pleasant blast of phenolic smokiness.  It brings back memories of sitting in the woods with friends with a small campfire burning away.  The phenolic scent howver beings to fade in to the background revealing the smell of oak, dark fruits and a touch of vanilla essence. There are also some slightly medicnal notes, perhaps a hint of iodine which I find extremely pleasing.


**The Taste**

The first sip gives you a burst of spice and charred wood, dried seadweed, phenolic and medicinal with hints of root ginger.  It's a fantastic burst of mouth tingling sensation.  As this first "slap in the face" fades you begin to pick up those dark fruits, sultana & plum.


**The Verdict**

Whisky is all about experience, and for this first article I specifically chose this expression knowing what I would get. In times that seem far removed from the norm sometimes we need a sharp jolt to keep us in the here and now and not the what if and when.  This expression of Laphroaig has done just that with its brazen nose and a taste that is a big "peaty slap in the face".

To everyone out there I toast to your good health and long may it continue.
