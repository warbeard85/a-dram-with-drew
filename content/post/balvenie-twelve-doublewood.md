10:30pm, the kids are in bed. My wife is in bed, even the dog is in bed! What a rare occurance to have the sitting room all to myself.


I have decided to use this infrequent occasion to sip, review and enjoy another whisky I have had in my collection for a while, but have not visited in some months.

And so it is just myself, the eerily quiet atmosphere of the sitting room and a bottle of Balvenie Double Wood 12 Year Old Single Malt Scotch Whisky.

 
The Balvenie 12 Year Old Doublewood is a speyside malt launched in 1993 which uses several different casks in its maturation process and is bottled at 40% ABV.

According to the Balvenie literature:

> To make The Balvenie DoubleWood, David Stewart MBE takes whisky that has spent at least 12 years in traditional whisky casks, American Oak ex-bourbon barrels and hogsheads, and moves it to Spanish oak ex-Oloroso sherry casks for an additional nine months. 

> The whisky is then transferred to large oak vessels called “tuns” for 3-4 months to allow the whiskies from individual casks to “marry”.  

 
### The Nose
 
Balvenie has a very pleasant and sweet nose, you can predominantly smell the influence of the sherry cask.  I'm also picking up sweet cherry scents and hints of almond which combined with the sweetness remindns me of the marizpan on a christmas cake.
 
 
### The Taste
 
This expression of Balvenie develops quite smoothly.  As with the nose there are sherry and cherry notes but this time they come with a little hint of spiced orange and cinnamon.  This is a smooth and oily whisky which coats the mouth giving a gentle, sweet oak finish.
 
 
### The Verdict
 
This is a sweet and pleasing dram, it isn't too challenging and is pretty easy to drink.  I didn't have to think too much about this one.  The flavours are all quite bold and pleasant and while I am quite biased towards  peated whiskies I still found this interesting and pleasant to drink.
