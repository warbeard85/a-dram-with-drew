Johnnie Walker black is a blended malt where all the different whiskies added are matured in barrels for at least 12 years, even the grain whiskies. The Black Label along with the Red Label is one of the best selling Scotch whiskies of all time.
Surely they must be doing something right?

Looking at this whisky you can see that it is quite heavily coloured with E150a (spirit caramel) and is as clear as a Norweigan lake in winter due to chill filtration. Perhaps it is judgmental of me to think of this as a scotch aimed at men in suits who want a dram in a tumbler after a hard day at the office, and that is fine. If you don’t want to drink whisky with caramel colouring there are other options out there.

From the Johnnie Walker Black Label marketing literature:

>Johnnie Walker Black Label is a perfectly balanced whisky crafted using single malt and grain whiskies drawn from the four corners of Scotland. It features whiskies from more than 29 distilleries - all aged for a minimum of 12 years - and has notes of vanilla, toffee and dark fruits before a uniquely smoky finish.

Lets get it poured and see what it's all about!

### The Nose

Nosing this whisky at first I am surprised by the toffee notes I am getting. I know it says it in the marketing literature but there is definitely a very heavy, sweet toffee note to this whisky. Once past the toffe notes I can pick up Molasses and dark fruits, a slight sweet waffle scent mixed with sultana. On the nose this is pretty pleasing and smooth, I am looking forward to the taste.

### The Taste

The taste is more intense then I expected, a big sweet honey arrival with the toffee flavour I picked up on the nose whish quickly fades away into cinnamon and spice. It's very smooth and oily, I find myself chewing that toffee taste. The finish leaves those dark fruits lingering on my palate. I'm not picking up much smokiness from this expression which is something that is on the product description but maybe that is because I am used to heavily peated single malts like Lapgroaig and Ardbeg.

### The Verdict

Johnnie Walker Black Label is pretty good, it isn’t as challenging or as raw as some of the single malts I own, in fact it is extremely smooth and easy to drink. I think this would be a great whisky to give to a friend who wants to try whisky neat for the first time. There are some intense flavours but they don’t overpower you or get in your face.

If you like a sweet smooth and easy to drink dram that doesn’t break the bank then I would recommend Johnnie Walker Black Label.
