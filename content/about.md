### A bit about me

Hi my name is Drew and by day I am a software developer base in Newcastle upon Tyne.  By night I like to taste, experience and research whisky.  

Over the years I have enjoyed many different whiskies, however, I am not a whisky snob.  I will try blended whisky, Irish whisky, bourbon etc, none age statement, the list goes on.

Whisky is a special and carefully crafted spirit which I drink for the experience of smell and taste.  We should always be aware of how much alcohol we consume and should do so responsibly.  Remember, you can have too much of a good thing.

### How I Mark the Malt

85% and above indicated a good malt.  80% to 85% indicates a decent malt but there is something detracting from the over all quality.  I won't review bad whisky.

Hope you find the site interesting!
